    - [ ] 2.3.6 echo
        - The echo command prints its arguments to the standard output:

            
                        $ echo Hello again.
                          Hello again.
        - The echo command is very useful for finding expansions of shell globs (“wildcards” such as *) and variables (such as $HOME).
         
- ### 2.4 Navigating Directories

    Unix has a directory hierarchy that starts at /, sometimes called the root directory. There are several standard subdirectories in the root directory such as /usr.

  When you refer to a file or directory, you specify a path or pathname. When a path starts with / (such as /usr/lib) it is a full or absolute path.
