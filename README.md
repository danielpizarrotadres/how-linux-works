- ### 2.1 The Bourne Shell: /bin/sh

    - [ ] 2.3.6 echo
        - The echo command prints its arguments to the standard output:

            
                        $ echo Hello again.
                          Hello again.
        - The echo command is very useful for finding expansions of shell globs (“wildcards” such as *) and variables (such as $HOME).
